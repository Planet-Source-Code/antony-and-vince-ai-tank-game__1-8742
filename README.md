### Description

This is a tank game that allows enemy tanks to shoot a player tank. It was initially designed as an artificial intelligence mini-project. The program allows a user to create maps and then play them.
 
### More Info
 
The first screen is a map editor (click on game screen to play).

The program has not been tested thoroughly and certain bugs may exist. System requirements are pretty high i.e. Pentium with 32 megs ram preferably.

Any feedback is welcome.
